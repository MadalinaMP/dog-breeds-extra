                    <p>Getting along with the kids, the cat and the guinea pig is no problem for the poodle. Lively and
                        affectionate, they make
                        wonderful companion dogs, the Toy will adapt to life in more confined quarters as long as they
                        get adequate exercise.
                        They can be good guard dogs, announcing visitors but never being aggressive. Poodles are
                        unusually sensitive to vocal
                        intonation, probably one of the reasons they are so easy to train. Many pet owners are using
                        gentle
                        and consistent training
                        methods.</p>
