                    <p>As a pet, the GSD will demand a lot of your time. It is a highly intelligent breed and as such,
                        needs a great deal of
                        mental stimulation. The GSD will develop a very close bond with his handler and will want to be
                        with him/her as much as
                        possible. They will accept children if the children give them respect and do not torment them.
                        Although this breed of
                        dog does need a lot of attention, he will give back one hundred fold with loyalty and
                        incorruptible guarding skills.</p>
