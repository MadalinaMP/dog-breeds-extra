                    <p>Rottweilers are unconditionally loyal to their handlers and their families and will defend them
                        and their property to
                        the end. They are protective and brave, and like many other dogs, can be jealous if attention is
                        given elsewhere.
                        Temperaments can however vary: some being independent, aloof and less-friendly, others being
                        outgoing and gregarious
                        with everyone. Please remember that some Rotties can be
                        aggressive and, as such,
                        are unsuitable for timid or unconfident owners.</p>
